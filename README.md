## Authors: Grand and Nixster 

Steps For Running The Code:
1. Get the dependencies from the ‘requirements.txt’ file.
	- Access to your preferred virtual environment.
	- At the root folder of the project, run ‘ pip install -r requirements.txt’.
2. Download the pascal VOC dataset using the following link http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar
3. Extract the files straight into the project root folder that we sent. Make sure the directory tree is something like this:
-	data/
-	|    VOCdevkit/
-	|    |    VOC2012/
-	|    |    |    Annotations/
-	|    |    |    csvs/
-	|    |    |    ImageSets/
-	|    |    |    JPEGImages/
-	|    |    |    SegmentationClass/
-	|    |    |    SegmentationObject/

4. To train the model, please run all the cells in the Ipython notebook.
5. Grab a cup of coffee while running the code
